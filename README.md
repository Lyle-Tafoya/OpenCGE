## OpenCGE

OpenCGE 3D game engine using component-based design in C++. While the libraries being used are all cross platform, I only intend to officially support SteamOS and other GNU/Linux operating systems during early development stages. Compile on Windows or OSX at your own risk.

### Current State

Currently this project is in it's early infancy and as such is not useable. I will continue to add more features and update this README as I go.

### Dependencies

Here are the dependencies I am developing with:
```
GLFW (Simplifies window creation and input handling)
GLM (for dealing with matrices)
Assimp (for loading various 3D model formats)
Boost
OpenAL (for sound)
```
