## OpenCGE

OpenCGE 3D game engine using component-based design in C++. While the libraries being used are all cross platform, I only intend to officially support GNU/Linux operating systems. Compile on Windows or OSX at your own risk.

### Current State

Currently this project is in it's early infancy and as such is not useable. All it can do is create a blank window. I will continue to add more features and update this README as I go.

### Dependencies

To compile OpenCGE you will need the following dependencies installed:
glfw

In the future I plan on using the following dependencies:
glm (for decent OpenGL matrix support)
assimp (for loading various 3D model formats)
OpenAL (for sound)
